            Virat Kohli was born into a Punjabi family to his father, Prem Kohli
            and mother, Saroj Kohli. His father passed away in 2006 due to a
            stroke at the age of 54 and was working as a criminal lawyer whereas
            his mother is a homemaker.
          </p>
          <p class="familyPara">
            Virat Kohli's mother, Saroj Kohli is a housewife. Virat is very
            close to his mother. When Virat started to focus on his fitness, his
            mother was worried that her son was becoming weaker. Virat had also
            worn a jersey with his mother's name on the back during an ODI
            against New Zealand in 2016.

              Virat Kohli's father, Prem Kohli was a criminal lawyer. He took
              him to the West Delhi Cricket Academy after neighbors advised that
              Virat was ready to play for a professional club. Unfortunately,
              Prem passed away before Kohli played for India. Prem died on
              December 18, 2006, when Virat was playing in the Ranji Trophy.
              Showing his commitment, Virat continued to play for Delhi soon
              after performing the last rites.

          <p class="earlyLifeSectionPara">
            Virat is the third child of the couple, with one elder brother-
            Vikas Kohli, and an elder sister- Bhawna Kohli. Virat spent most of
            his childhood in Delhi and also got his training in the national
            capital. And it was this training, hard work, and persistence that
            led him to the heights of success.
          </p>
          <p class="earlyLifeSectionPara">
            When West Delhi Cricket Academy was created in 1998, Kohli was part
            of its first batch and received training under Rajkumar Sharma.
          </p>
          <p class="earlyLifeSectionPara">
            Kohli made his cricket debut in October 2002 with the Delhi Under-15
            team in the 2002-03 Polly Umrigar Trophy and lead the team for the
            next trophy. He was later selected in the Delhi Under-17 team for
            the 2003-04 Vijay Merchant Trophy where he finished as the highest
            run-scorer.
          </p>
          <p class="earlyLifeSectionPara">
            At the age of 18, Kohli made his first-class debut for Delhi against
            Tamil Nadu wherein he scored 10 runs. In July 2006, he made his
            debut in the Under-19 team during India's tour of England. India won
            both ODI and Test series. Kohli made his T20 debut next year and
            emerged as the highest run-scorer in the Inter-State T20
            Championship with 179 runs.
          </p>
          <p class="earlyLifeSectionPara">
            The year 2008 was a life-changing year for Kohli. First, he
            captained the Under-19 Cricket World Cup-winning team. Second, he
            was bought by RCB for $30,000 on a youth contract for IPL. Third, he
            made his international debut.
          </p>
          <p class="earlyLifeSectionPara">
            After recovering from a minor injury, Kohli replaced Gambhir for the
            tri-series in Sri Lanka and batter at no. 4 in the 2009 ICC
            Champions Trophy as Yuvraj Singh was recovering from an injury.
          </p>
          <p class="earlyLifeSectionPara">
            For the tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh in 2010, Tendulkar
            was rested, thereby enabling Kohli to play in each match. Due to his
            phenomenal performance in Bangladesh, he was praised by the then
            captain MS Dhoni.
          </p>
          <p class="earlyLifeSectionPara">
            Kohli was part of the World Cup-winning team in 2011 and became the
            first Indian batsman to score a century on World Cup debut.
          </p>
          <p class="earlyLifeSectionPara">
            Kohli made his Test debut against West Indies at Kingston and
            performed poorly in the series, amassing just 76 runs in five
            innings. In 2015, he became the first Indian batsman to score a
            century against Pakistan in a World Cup match.

            in his 27th innings.
          </p>
          <p class="careerSectionPara">
            During the ODI tour of Australia, Kohli emerged as the fastest
            batsman in the world to cross the 7000-run mark in ODIs, and the
            fastest to score 25 centuries.
          </p>

            During the 3 match Test series against Sri Lanka at home in 2017, he
            became the first batsman to score six double hundreds as a captain.
            That year, he scored a total of 2818 international runs, the
            third-highest by an Indian in a calendar year and highest ever by an
            Indian player.
          </p>
          <p class="careerSectionPara">
            In August 2018, he ranked no. 1 in the ICC Test rankings. With this,

            three successive centuries in ODIs in October 2018.
          </p>

          <p class="careerSectionPara">
            Kohli captained the 2013 West Indies tri-series winning team after
            Dhoni injured himself during the match. He also captained a
            five-match ODI tour of Zimbabwe, which India won by 5-0, their first
            in any away ODI series.

          </p>
          <p class="careerSectionPara">
            He led India in the first Test of the Australian tour and scored 115
            runs in the first innings, thereby becoming the fourth Indian to

            retirement from Test cricket at the conclusion of the third match
            between India and Australia, and Kohli was appointed as the
            full-time Test captain ahead of the fourth Test at Sydney.
          </p>
          <p class="careerSectionPara">
            At Sydney, Kohli scored 147 in the first innings and became the
            first batter in the Test cricket history to score three hundred in
            his first three innings as Test captain. He was named as captain of
